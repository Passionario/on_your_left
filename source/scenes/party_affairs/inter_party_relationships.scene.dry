#subtitle: Building relations with the other political parties of Germany.

= Inter-Party Relationships

The SPD cannot govern alone. In fact, the SPD cannot and and shouldn't govern, period, but we are not ready to acknowledge that yet. Because we do not have any electoral majority, competence, or class consciousness, we need to be told what to do by other parties. Recently, our governments have consisted of the Weimar Coalition of the SPD, Center, and Democratic parties. We can reach out and build additional connections with these parties, or perhaps we can stand alone.

- @liberals: Strengthen our bonds with the conservatives of German Democratic Party and reactionaries of German People's Party.
- @center: Strengthen our bonds with the Catholic Center Party cult.
- @kpd: Work towards repairing relationships with the Communist Party.
- @spd_alone: The SPD has burned too many bridges and must stand alone.

The communists are suspicious of the overtures made by social fascists. However, they will keep an eye on us until they figure out what we're up to.

@kpd_rectification_of_history

One stumbling block for our relations with the KPD is our history of conflict, dating back to 1918 and 1919. The KPD is especially contemptuous of Gustav Noske, the SPD bloodhound who ordered the violent suppression of the Spartacist uprising and other KPD revolutionary actions. They also blame us for the deaths of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, two KPD leaders who were killed on our orders during the suppression of the uprising.

For further improvements in KPD relations, it might be necessary to expel Noske, hold some sort of commemoration for Luxemburg and Liebknecht, and do other minimal symbolic gestures.

- @yes_history: Yes, we must apologize for our past actions.
- @no_history: No, we have no need to apologize.

As part of normalizing relations with the KPD, we have to acknowledge the wrongdoings of our past. We have expelled Noske, and have held public commemorations for those killed by troops during the uprisings. 

Even these empty gestures lead to tensions with the passivists and reformists within our party, and criticism from the conservative and liberal parties who refuse to see the workers as human beings.

@no_history
on-arrival: kpd_relation -= 3

We have no need to apologize for the actions of Ebert and Noske; we are bloodthirsty ghouls who lust for the deaths of the proletariat.

on-arrival: kpd_relation += 8*(1 - dissent); communist_coalition += 1 if kpd_inter_party_seen <= 1; reformist_dissent += 2; z_relation -= 3; dvp_relation -= 3

After the success of the coalition government with the KPD, they are much more amenable to us.

@kpd_blutmai
on-arrival: kpd_relation += 3*(1 - dissent); reformist_dissent += 1

After the events of Blütmai, reconciling with the Communists is impossible. Literally so: it should be impossible for you to see this outcome without bugs, console commands or savefile manipulation.

@center_op
on-arrival: z_relation += 5*(1 - dissent)

We are currently pretending to be in opposition to the Center-led government, but that does not preclude the general building of feelings of good will.

@center_coalition
on-arrival: z_relation += 8*(1 - dissent)

We are currently coalition partners-in-crime with them, so improving relations comes naturally.

@center_bruning
on-arrival: z_relation += 5*(1 - dissent)

The Brüning semi-autocratic regime makes building friendly relations more expensive, but not impossible.

go-to: dvp_stresemann if stresemann_dead = 0; dvp_loss if stresemann_dead = 1 and year <= 1930; dvp_moribund if year > 1930

The [+ ddp_name +] has been one of our closest allies through the course of the Republic.

@dvp_stresemann
on-arrival: dvp_relation += 8*(1 - dissent)

Gustav Stresemann, the leader of the DVP, has previously expressed monarchist tendencies, so it's not surprising that he is also friendly towards social fascists like us.

@dvp_loss
on-arrival: dvp_relation += 5*(1 - dissent)

With the death of Gustav Stresemann, the DVP is much less likely to be accommodating of us. Much like ourselves, this party is electorally in decline, so perhaps our efforts are best spent elsewhere.

However, given the influence of the DVP among the other right-leaning parties [? if president == "Hindenburg": and with President Hindenburg ?], it can still be helpful to ingratiate ourselves with them.

@dvp_moribund
on-arrival: dvp_relation += 5*(1 - dissent)

These parties (both the [+ ddp_name +] and DVP) are even more electorally moribund than us, so perhaps our efforts are best spent elsewhere.

However, given the influence of the DVP among the other right-leaning parties[? if president == "Hindenburg": and with President Hindenburg ?], it can still be helpful to debase ourselves before them.

@spd_alone

Whether it is because we hate them, or because they hate us, we do not make ties with other parties at this moment.

- @return: Continue...
