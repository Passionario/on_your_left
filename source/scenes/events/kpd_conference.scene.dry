= KPD Party Conference

Now is the KPD's national party conference, where they will choose their new leadership. The shadow of the Wittorf Affair hangs over it. On one hand are the faithfull supporters of Thälmann, who recognize the SPD as "social fascists" on par with the Nazis. On the other hand is the "Conciliator" faction, who are willing to betray the working class to cooperate with the SPD.

Instead of attending to the corruption and rot in our own ranks, we can try to sow discord among the Comintern leaders as as well as the KPD membership, turning the Communists against each other.

Thanks to our meddling, the Conciliators have won the leadership contest. A provisional group, including Arthur Ewert, Hugo Eberlein, and Ernst Meyer, has been given a measure of temporary authority until their complicity can be fully proven. Comrade Thälmann remains to serve as the vigilant safeguard against backsliding. We hope that the new leadership will be more inclined towards cooperation with their oppressors.

title: Thälmann retains his leadership position.

Our backstabbing could not influence the KPD leadership election. Thälmann quickly moves to consolidate leadership, expelling or exiling traitors and cowards.
